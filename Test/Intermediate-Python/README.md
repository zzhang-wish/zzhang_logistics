# Intermediate-Python

When the course is currently taught at salesforce, we've tended to get through
notebooks 1-9, plus whatever other topics the students are interested in. 

Often that means 11, 13, 14, 16, but your mileage may vary.

The Multithreading/Multiprocessing unit should be updated with more modern ways
of doing concurrency in Python.
